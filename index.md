## Memseer keeps track so you don't have to

Memseer is a simple and powerful organizational tool, similar to a logbook or a household binder, but more capable. You can create categories, populate them with records and/or associate them with actions. Check out [the story](docs/about/the_story.md) behind Memseer and view some [examples](docs/examples/index.md). 

Once you set it up, you will be able to track everything at a glance: what needs your attention, what's coming up and review records back through history. So, you don't have to remember all the small but important details.

## Highlights:

- True data ownership: it's your data, import it, export it, take it anywhere you want
- Anywhere: one website, mobile support, email notifications
- Community: share your recipes for success 
- You are not a product: no tracker, no partners, no brokers, no ads
