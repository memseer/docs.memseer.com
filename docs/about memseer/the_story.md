# The Story

How Memseer came to be

[Memseer](https://memseer.com) is a product of my deep desire - I want everything running smoothly but without having to remember when and what to do.

It all started years ago when I used to have a small car with an interference engine. Interference engine is an engine where valve and piston traverse the same
space but are carefully timed so they never meet each other. The engine has a timing belt that controls the valves and if the belt breaks, bad things will
happen. If you are lucky, a couple valves might be broken, if unlucky the engine becomes junk. So I figured to keep a log with mileage and when the all
important belt needed replacement. Not long after I also realized that there are other things that needed to be replaced on time or I might end up walking down
the road.

Car as important as it is, isn’t the only thing to keep an eye on. I have UPS and it needs to have its battery replaced every 5-6 years, once again best case
UPS doesn’t function properly, in worst case battery can actually burst into fire. What about air filter in HVAC system, I sure forgot about it few times and I
never remember which filter size to buy. Personal health, when was my last checkup? What about pets, do they need yearly shots? Did I miss house insurance and
what was the amount last year? Does my water filter need to be replaced? Is my treadmill track lubricated? And the list keeps going.

All those small things make an impact on our lives. The problem is: how to keep track of all those small things? One way is sticky notes, but where do I keep
them? On a fridge? On a furnace? Next to an entrance? Do I need to regularly revisit all those stickies and make sure stuff is done? Do sticky notes sometimes
get lost? And once I’m done with a task, do I have a history to refer to, if the needs arise? Perhaps all the sticky notes can be organized into a binder,
collected, managed and evaluated every weekend to figure out when and what chore needs to be done.

I tried the above approach with very limited success, unhealthy amount of anxiety, and I still couldn't remember which air filter size to buy once I got to the
store. Perhaps there is a better way, organize notes into digital binder. It is always in one place - any place you are at! You can access it from anywhere on
any device. Notes don’t get lost, complete history is always available. You don’t need to review all the notes every weekend to see when and what needs to
be done. As a matter of fact, you don’t even have to make notes anymore, only rules and all the chores show up in simple & easy to understand format. Now I
don’t have to remember when it is time to take my car to the shop for maintenance. I don’t have to memorize air filter size. I don’t worry that I missed
something. All those small things are right in the palm of my hand.
